# Lung Cancer Analysis - Data-Driven Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores **lung cancer prevalence** by comparing **developed and developing countries** using data analysis techniques. The goal is to uncover trends, risk factors, and insights that can help improve **healthcare access and outcomes**.

## 🔍 Objective
- Analyze **lung cancer prevalence rates** across different regions.
- Compare data between **developed and developing countries**.
- Identify key risk factors using **data-driven insights**.
- Use advanced tools for visualization and predictive analysis.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL (SQLite3)** - Data extraction and transformation
- **Power BI** - Data storytelling & visualization
- **Excel** - Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Python (Pandas)** - with sql

## 📌 Key Findings
- **Higher prevalence** of lung cancer in developed countries due to lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, pollution).
- **Developing countries** show rising cases due to increasing industrialization and smoking habits.
- **Preventive measures** such as early diagnosis and government initiatives significantly impact survival rates.

## 📉 Visualizations & Insights
Power BI dashboards and **data visualizations** were used to highlight:
- Global distribution of lung cancer cases.
- Mortality rates and survival trends.
- Correlation between smoking rates and lung cancer cases.
